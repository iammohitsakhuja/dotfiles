# Mohit's Dotfiles

A collection of useful dotfiles and scripts.

## Installation

**Warning:** Even though most of the scripts can work on any \*nix platform,
however some parts are exclusive to MacOS. I recommend forking this repository,
reviewing the code, and making changes to it accordingly before running the
installation script. Don't just blindly use my settings unless you know what
that entails. Use at your own risk!

To install, run the following:

```zsh
$ bash install.sh -l
```

You can use the `-h` or `--help` flag while running the above command to get
help.
