# Mohit's Dotfiles

A collection of useful dotfiles and scripts.

## Installation

**Warning:** Even though most dotfiles will work right out of the box for any
\*nix platform, some files are exclusive to MacOS. These files are usually
scripts. I recommend forking this repository, reviewing the code, and making
changes to it accordingly before running the installation script.
Don't just blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.
Use at your own risk!

To install, run the following:

```zsh
$ sudo chmod u+x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
Linking config files into ~/ ...
```

You can use the `-h` or `--help` flag while running the above command to get
help.
